/*
Concurrency = whenever things are happening "at the same time" or in parallel
we can do a call to some API and not wait for the reply but do something useful in the meantime instead. 
We can do so using the concept of concurrency.

There are three strategies in JavaScript that you'll need to know of when working
with concurrency: callbacks, Promises, and the async and await keywords
