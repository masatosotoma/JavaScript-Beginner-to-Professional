/*

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. A thread in this context means a path of execution. 
If there is only a single path, this means that tasks will have to wait for one another and only one thing can happen at a time.

Event loop = The single executor. a process that executes the actual work. Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, 
it doesn't mean that it cannot outsource some tasks and wait for them to come back. 
This is exactly how JavaScript manages to do things in a multithreaded manner
