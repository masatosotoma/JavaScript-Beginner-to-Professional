// split() = to convert a string to an array. It's not a change of the original string, but make a new array
// You have to tell the split method on what string it should split

//example
let result = "Hello JavaScript";
let arr_result = result.split(" "); // split by every space

console.log(arr_result);

//example2
let favauriteFruits = "strawberry,watermelon,grapefruit";
let arr_fruits = favauriteFruits.split(","); // split by every ,

console.log(arr_fruits);
