<!--
    Local Storage = save key-value pairs in our web browser and use them again in a new session 
    (when the browser is opened again later). The information is typically stored in a 
    folder on the computer of the user, but this differs a bit by browser.

    the website to store some information and retrieve it later, 
    even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. 
    The advantage of local storage over cookies is that they don't need to be passed around with every HTTP request

    LocalStorage object = . First of all, we need to be able to get and set key-value pairs on local storage. 
    We use setItem() whenever we want to save something and getItem() whenever we want to retrieve the value later
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="stored"></div>
    <script>
      let messages = "Hello storage!";
      //You can add items to storage by specifying a key and a value with the setItem method.
      localStorage.setItem("example", messages);

      if (localStorage.getItem("example")) {
        document.getElementById("stored").innerHTML =
          localStorage.getItem("example");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    We can also retrieve a key using the index. 
    This is useful whenever we need to loop through the key-value pairs and we don't know the names of the keys

    => window.localStorage.key(0);

    In this case, the key is name. In order to get the associated value, we can do this

    => window.localStorage.getItem(window.localStorage.key(0));

    We can also remove key-value pairs like this:

    => window.localStorage.removeItem("name");

    And we can remove all the key-value pairs from the local storage in one call

    => window.localStorage.clear();

    *With local storage you can save values even after closing the browser
