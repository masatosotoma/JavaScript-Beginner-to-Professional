<!--
1.Open your script in your chosen editor, or the Sources tab of your browser's
Inspect panel. Click to the left of the line of code where you want to add a
breakpoint.

2.Run the code with your new breakpoints: I have selected Run | Start
Debugging,

3.There will be a tab that lists the
variables in the code and the current values at the first breakpoint. It's called
VARIABLES in my editor, but it's the Scope tab in the Chrome browser
console.

4.You can use the menu options to move to the next breakpoint, stop
debugging, or restart the breakpoint sequence. Press the play icon to move to
the next breakpoint.

5.Press the play icon once more, and the script will run until it hits the next
breakpoint, at which point the value of the variable will update as a result of
the code on line 2:

6.Press play again to move to the next breakpoint, which increases the value of
val once more:

7.Once the last breakpoint is reached you will only see options to restart or
stop the debugger. If you press stop, it will end the debugging process

The final value of val after the third breakpoint was revealed as 135
