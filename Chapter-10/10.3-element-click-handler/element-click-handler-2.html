<!--
    Instead of using onclick method (from element click handler 1),
    you can also refer to a function that's in that JavaScript like below
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      function stop() {
        alert("Ouch! Stop it!");
      }
    </script>
    <div id="one" onclick="stop()">Don't click here!</div>
  </body>
</html>
