<!--
You can access elements using a CSS selector, which can do with these commands
- querySelector()
- querySelectorAll()

Give the CSS selector as an argument, 
and this will filter the items in the HTML document and only return the ones that satisfy the CSS sector.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Just an example</h1>
    <div id="one" class="example">Hi!</div>
    <div id="two" class="example">Hi!</div>
    <div id="three" class="something">Hi!</div>
  </body>
  <script>
    console.log(document.querySelectorAll("p"));
  </script>
</html>

<!--
    If we say p.example, it means all the p tag elements with example as the class. 
    They can also have other classes; as long as example is in there, it will match. 
    querySelector() allows for more complicated queries, 
    and some developers will state that getElementById() is more readable.
