<!--
Events = things that happen on a web page, like clicking on something, moving the mouse over an elemen etc
Event handlers = the handler to apply an event such as onclick()

event listeners = add multiple events to one element. 
In this way,JavaScript is constantly checking, or listening, for certain events to the elements on the page
the two-step process of adding event listeners 
1. Select the element you want to add an event to
2. Use the addEventListener("event", function) syntax to add the event

This can be done  in one line of code:
document.getElementById("square").addEventListener("click",changeColor);

when using event listeners, you remove the on prefix from the event type.

We could reuse our trusty onclick listener in this context, 
but another common one is when the web page is done loading with onload:

window.onload = function() {
 // whatever needs to happen after loading
 // for example adding event listeners to elements
}

example below
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      window.onload = function () {
        document
          .getElementById("square")
          .addEventListener("click", changeColor);
      };
      function changeColor() {
        let red = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
        let green = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
        let blue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
        this.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`;
      }
    </script>
    <div
      id="square"
      style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: grey"
    >
      Click for Magic!
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    The web page starts with a gray square with the text Click for magic in it. 
    After the web page is done loading, an event gets added for this square
    You can add events to all sorts of elements.
    Whenever it gets clicked, the changeColor function will be executed
