<!--
If you did not only want to work with plain text, or perhaps specify some HTML 
formatting with your value, you could use the innerHTML property 
It doesn't just process be plain text, it can also be inner HTML elements:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome page</h1>
    <p id="greeting">Hi!</p>
    <script>
      document.body.children.greeting.innerHTML="<b>Bye!</b>";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    document.body.children.greeting.innerHTML = "<b>Bye!</b>"

    This will display Bye! in bold on the screen.
    This having taken the b element into account rather than pringting it as it were a string value
