Try to traverse the DOM of the code above to find the treasure

1. find body element => console.dir(document.body);

childNodes = just contain all the HTML elements, so are really the nodes.
It also contain text nodes and comments.

2. using children, get to the treasure element =>
console.dir(document.body.children.forest.children.tree2.children.shrubbery.children.treasure);

3. To get to the treasure using childNodes you would have to use your console a lot
because text and comment nodes are also in there. childNodes is an array, so you will
have to select the right index to select the right child.
one advantage:  it is a lot shorter because you won't need to select the name separately
=>
console.dir(document.body.childNodes[3].childNodes[3].childNodes[1].childNodes[1]);

or you can also combine them

console.dir(document.body.childNodes[3].childNodes[3].childNodes[1].children.treasure);

**************************************************
How to move up the DOM

parentElement = to move back up the DOM

Example: (start from children and moving up to the parent)
document.body.children.forest.tree2.parentElement;
=> in the console, you are back at forest

previousElementSibiling = You can also move sideways to find the node.
Example:
document.body.children.forest.children.tree2;
=> to find the tree1 using below
document.body.children.forest.children.tree2.previousElementSibling;

nextElementSibling = to get the next node
document.body.children.forest.children.tree1.nextElementSibling;
=> get the tree2
