<!--
    The innerText property focuses on the text between the opening and closing of the element
    <element>here</element>

    To change the text of the element
    document.body.children.greeting.innerText = "Bye!";

    If there is any HTML inside the element you need to select, you can't do this way, but need to use innerHTML
    document.body.children.greeting.innerText = "<p>Bye</p>" => wrong way
