    How to set upt the canvas:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <canvas id="c1"></canvas>
    <script></script>
  </body>
</html>

You could add some CSS to add a border to the canvas or a background color to the body and your canvas will be revealed.

  <head>
    <style>
      canvas {
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="c1"></canvas>
    <script>
      let canvas = document.getElementById("c1");
      let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
      canvas.width = 500; //px
      canvas.height = 500; //px
      ctx.fillStyle = "pink"; //We can also change the color we are drawing with
      ctx.fillRect(20, 40, 100, 100);
      /*With the fillRect() method on the context of the canvas, we can draw a rectangle on the canvas. 
      It takes four parameters. The first two are the x and y coordinates of where the figure should be added to the canvas 
      The last two are the width and height of the rectangle*/
