<!--
    It gives a blank HTML page with a Choose file button and the No file chosen comment behind it.
    Clicking on the button pops up the filesystem and you can select a file.
    After selecting the file, the JavaScript gets triggered. And as you can see, 
    we are sending in the property files that are active in our body.
    This is a list of files. Therefore, we are grabbing the 0th index, 
    the first element in the list. Files are represented as objects.

    The file object gets logged to the console here, which enables you to see all the properties and associated values. 
    Some of the important properties are the name, size, type, and lastModified, but there are many more.
