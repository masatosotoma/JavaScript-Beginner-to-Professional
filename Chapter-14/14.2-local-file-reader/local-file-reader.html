<!--
Using HTML5 feature, we can upload files from our device to our web app and read from them in our app
we can attach files to forms for example, which is great in many cases whenever we
need to upload some sort of file for whatever purpose, for example, adding a résumé to your online job application.
-->

<!--Example:-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="message"></div>
    <script>
      let message = document.getElementById("message");
      if (window.FileReader) {
        message.innerText = "Good to go!";
      } else {
        message.innerText = "No FileReader :(";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    If you open this file in your browser it should say Good to go! when your browser supports file reading.
    Try updating your browser or using another one if it says No FileReader :(. 
    Browsers that will work are, for example, Chrome and Firefox.
