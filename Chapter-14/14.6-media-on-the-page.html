<!--There are special elements for media on the page. 
    We are going to show you how to add audio and video and how to embed YouTube on a webpage.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <!--You specify the controls attribute if you want the user to be able to control pause and play and the volume-->
    <audio controls>
      <!--If you want it to start automatically, you'll have to add the attribute autoplay-->
      <!--With the source element, you specify the audio files that can be played-->
      <source src="sound.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
      <source src="sound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    </audio>
    <!--Adding a video to a webpage is very similar to adding audio-->
    <video width="1024" height="576" controls>
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
    </video>
    <!--Often you would want to link to YouTube instead-->
    <!--You will have to use the iframe element. This is a special element that allows another webpage inside the current webpage.-->
    <iframe
      width="1024"
      height="576"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6VTv7czb1Y"
    >
    </iframe>
    <!--you can then add the YouTube embed link as a source. The last code after embed comes from the video URL.-->
  </body>
</html>

<!--If you want it to be only a part of the screen, you can adjust the width and height attributes accordingly-->
