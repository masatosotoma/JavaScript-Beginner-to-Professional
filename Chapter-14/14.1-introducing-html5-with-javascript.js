/*
HTML5 is formally a version of HTML.
When you read HTML5 in a job description, it often means more than just HTML. 
Usually, the combination of HTML5 with JavaScript, CSS, JSON, and others is included here as well.

Since HTML5 the structure of our page has improved. We have new elements such as <header>, <nav>, and <article>

we can play videos with the <video> element, which means we no longer need Flash since HTML5
we can work with the <canvas> element to create visuals on the page or to represent visuals such as animation, graphs, and others

Some things that had to be done with JavaScript in the past can now be done solely with HTML, 
such as adding video and audio to a webpage.
