      /*Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using 
the Pythagorean theorem when given the values of the other two sides. 
The theorem specifies that the relation between the sides of a right-angled triangle is a2 + b2 = c2.*/

      let sideA = prompt("What is the number for A?");
      let sideB = prompt("What is the number for B?");

      let sideC = sideA ** 2 + sideB ** 2;
      let answer = Math.sqrt(sideC);
      /*You can use prompt() to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the value from the user for a and b. 
    Then square the values of both a and b before adding them together 
    and finding the square root. Print your answer to the console.*/
