/*
API (Application Programming Interface) is essentially an interface for code,
written with more code. A request can be made to an API using (for example) a URL.
This will trigger a certain piece of code and this piece of code will give a certain response back.

Whenever a user has filled out all the fields and clicks on Submit booking, 
the API will get triggered by calling the URL and sending all the data that the user has entered to that endpoint (a specific URL)

APIs work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) calls. 
HTTP is just a protocol for communication between two parties: a client and a server, 
or a server and another server (in which the requesting server acts like the client)
