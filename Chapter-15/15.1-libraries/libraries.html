<!--
    Frameworks and libraries allow us to develop to a higher quality a lot faster and pre-made, 
    and this is why they are so popular.

    Many of the libraries can be included in a page by adding a script tag to the head of the HTML, like below
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://linktolibrary.com/librarycode.js"></script>
