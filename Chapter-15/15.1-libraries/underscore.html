    The Underscore library offers a lot of functions for everyday programming, 
    such as map, filter, invoke, and functions for testing. Here is a little code snippet showing some Underscore, 
    which makes an alert pop-up box for all the items in the arrayâ€”in this case, it is making a pop-up for 1, 2, and 3:

  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/underscore@1.13.1/underscore-umd-min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      _.each([1, 2, 3], alert);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

    Underscore is a JavaScript library that can be summarized as a toolkit for functional programming. 
    Functional programming can be considered a programming paradigm, 
    it revolves around using descriptive functions in a sequence rather than separate examples. 
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is also a programming paradigm, which is all about objects and their state, 
    and the data can be encapsulated and hidden from the outside code
