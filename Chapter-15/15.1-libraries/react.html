<!-- 
    React a library is that you'll need to use some other libraries to get to the point where it feels like a framework.

    React is used to build beautiful and dynamic user interfaces. 
    It splits up pages into different components and the data gets sent and updated between components as it changes.

    Here is a very basic example that only scratches the very surface of what React can do


    <div id="root"></div>

    ReactDOM.render(  
        <p> Hi Emile, what's up?</p>,  
        document.getElementById('root');
        );
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script>
      let p = React.createElement("p", null, "Hi Emile, what's up?");
      ReactDOM.render(p, document.getElementById("root"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    This will write Hi Emile, what's up? to the page using React elements created manually in the script tag.
    It is way more valuable to set up React and everything you need using a package manager such as Node Package Manager (NPM). 
    This will allow you to easily manage all the dependencies and keep your code organized.
