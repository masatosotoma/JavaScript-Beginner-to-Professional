<!-- jQuery = one of the most famous JavaScript libraries.  It was great to use in the past, 
    when it would be compiled into the latest version of JavaScript for the specific browser-->

<!--When you click the Great idea button, all the paragraphs will be hidden. 
  This is done inside the event that's been added using jQuery. 
  First, we selected the button with the ID hidebutton, next we call the click function on it, 
  which specifies what will happen on click. In that function, 
  we state that we'll select all p elements and hide them. 
  hide is a special jQuery function that adds the display:none style to the HTML element.-->

  <!-- after clicking, all the paragraphs are gone. When we click on Found you!, 
    only one comes back, the last one reading I'm easy to find. 
    This is because when the button with the ID revealbutton gets clicked, 
    it selects all elements with class easy and removes the display:none from the style using the jQuery show function-->
