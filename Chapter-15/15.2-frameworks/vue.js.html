<!--
    Vue.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework. 
    It can be used to build user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). 
    The way user interfaces are written with Vue.js can be hard to get your head around the first time you encounter it

        <!--This element will only be displayed when the condition in that v-if is true-->
        <!--If you change the value of this hide to true, the negated hide statement will become false, 
          and the element will disappear-->
        Let's play hide and seek. <br />

        obj._data.hide = true <br />

<!--In the preceding code, a new Vue component is created, and it can actually hold data and have a function too, 
  but this one is very basic and just to illustrate we can add HTML templates in the template property-->

<!--The content of one page can come from many files. Usually these components all have their own file. 
  There is a lot more official Vue tooling that you will get to know once you dive into Vue.js-->
