<!--
    In this case, it has the default behavior. It will execute all five events, so each one of every nested div.
    And it will execute them inside out. So it will start with the innerText of only 5, then 45, until the last one, 12345:

Event bubbling = It's what happens when you trigger the handlers on an element. 
                 It runs its own events first, then its parents, and so on. 
                 It is called bubbling because it goes up from the inner event to the outer

Event capturing = This moving from the outer element to the inner element.

Event delegation = The event capturing and bubbling allows us to apply a principle.
                   Event delegation is the concept where instead of adding event handlers to every element in a certain block of HTML, 
                   define a wrapper and add the event to this wrapper element, and it then applies to all the child elements as well
