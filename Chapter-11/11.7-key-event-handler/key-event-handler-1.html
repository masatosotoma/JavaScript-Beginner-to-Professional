<!--
    onkeypass =  whenever a key gets pressed, it's triggered. Pressing means when the button is pressed and released
    onkeydown = As soon as the button is pressed (before releasing), an event happens
    onkeyup = the event happens when the pressing is released

    event.key = you can get the key that triggered the event using this.
    
    Example: we can restrict what characters can be entered in an input box. 
    Every time a key gets pressed, we can check the character and decide whether it gets to stay.
