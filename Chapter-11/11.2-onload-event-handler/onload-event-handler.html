        If you need two events to happen when the DOM is loaded, 
        you will need two addEventListener() calls in your JavaScript

<!--
    onload = execute something after a certain element is loaded.
    It's useful if you want to select an element using getElementById, 
    you'll have to be sure this element is loaded in the DOM already.
    Most commonly used with window object like =>  window.onload
    When you use it on window, this event gets started when the window object is done loading
-->

<!--
    DOMContentLoaded = can be used to handle the event of the DOM loading, 
    which will get fired immediately after DOM for the page has been constructed when the event is set.
