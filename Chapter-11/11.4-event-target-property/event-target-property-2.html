<!--
    A use case where parent properties can come in handy is in the case of HTML forms,
    where there are multiple input fields and a button. A button in a form would often
    have the form as its direct parent. Via this parent, data from the input fields can be
    fetched. This is demonstrated in the following example
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="welcome">Hi there!</div>
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="firstname" placeholder="First Name" />
      <input type="text" name="lastname" placeholder="Last Name" />
      <input type="button" onclick="sendInfo()" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <script>
      function sendInfo() {
        //The parent element of the button, the form in this case, gets stored in the p variable.
        //This command will get the value of the input box
        let p = event.target.parentElement;
        message("Welcome" + p.firstname.value + " " + p.lastname.value);
      }

      function message(m) {
        document.getElementById("welcome").innerHTML = m;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
