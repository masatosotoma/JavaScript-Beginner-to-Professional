<!--console.dir(event) = Whenever an event gets fired, an event variable becomes available. It has many
properties, and you can check it out by using this command in the function that gets fired for the event:-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <button type="button" onclick="triggerSomething()">Click</button>
    <script>
      function triggerSomething() {
        console.dir(event.target);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--In this case, event.target is the button element. In the console, the button element
and all its properties will be logged, including potential siblings and parents-->
